    eligibility(model::VeryAbstractCICModel)

Calculate unit eligibility across all treated observations.

# Arguments  
- `model`: Fitted TSCSMethods model

# Returns
- `Matrix{Int}`: Eligibility matrix (units Ã— time periods F)

# Description
For each potential control unit, calculates how many times it is eligible
to serve as a match across all treated observations and time periods.
Higher eligibility indicates units that are consistently good potential matches
for multiple treated units.

Useful for identifying:
- Units that are consistently good matches across multiple treated observations
- Potential issues with match quality or overlap
- Whether certain units dominate the matching process
- Balance in the matching pool

# Examples
```julia
eligibility_matrix = eligibility(model)

# Find highly eligible units
total_eligibility = sum(eligibility_matrix, dims=2)
highly_eligible_indices = findall(x -> x > 5, vec(total_eligibility))

    whentreated(unit_id::Int, model::VeryAbstractCICModel)

Find when a specific unit received treatment.

# Arguments

- `model`: Fitted TSCSMethods model

# Returns
- `Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}}`: Treatment events for this unit as (treatment_time, unit_id)

# Description
Searches through all treatment observations to find when (if ever)
a specific unit received treatment. Returns all treatment events
for units that may have multiple treatments over time.

This function is useful for:
- Verifying treatment timing for specific units
- Checking if a unit received treatment multiple times
- Debugging treatment assignment issues
- Understanding the treatment history of particular units

# Examples
```julia
# Check when unit 1001 was treated

    showmatches(model::VeryAbstractCICModel, treatment_observation::Tuple{Int, Int})

Show ranked matches for a specific treatment observation.

# Arguments
- `model`: Fitted TSCSMethods model  
- `treatment_observation`: Tuple of (treatment_time, unit_id)

# Returns
- `Vector{Vector{Int}}`: Ranked matches for each time period F (sorted best to worst)
- `"Treatment observation not found"`: If observation doesn't exist in model

# Description
For a specific treatment event, shows the ranked list of matched control unit indices
for each time period in the post-treatment window F. Units are ranked from
best match (rank 1) to worst match based on the matching algorithm's distance
calculations and balancing constraints.

The returned structure is a vector where each element corresponds to a time period F,
containing the ranked list of control unit indices (internal to model.matches).
To get actual unit IDs, use `model.ids[index]`.

This function is useful for:
- Debugging matching quality for specific treatment events
- Understanding which units serve as matches across different time periods
- Assessing match consistency over time
- Manual inspection of matching results

# Examples
```julia
# Show matches for unit 1001 treated at time 15

    matchinfo(model::Union{CIC, CICStratified}; maxrank = 5)

Generate match information DataFrame for standard CIC models.

# Purpose
Creates a detailed summary of matching results showing which control units
were matched to each treated observation across all forward periods (F).
Provides match unit IDs and their ranking within each time period.

# Arguments
- `model`: Fitted CIC or CICStratified model with completed matching
- `maxrank`: Maximum number of top-ranked matches to include per F period (default: 5)

# Returns
`DataFrame` with columns:
- `timetreated`: Time when treatment occurred
- `treatedunit`: ID of the treated unit
- `f`: Forward period within the outcome window
- `matchunits`: Vector of matched control unit IDs (ranked best to worst)
- `ranks`: Vector of rank positions (1 = best match, 2 = second best, etc.)

# Description
For each treatment observation and each forward period F, this function:
1. Extracts the top `maxrank` matched control units
2. Converts internal match indices to actual unit IDs
3. Filters out periods with no available matches
4. Returns results sorted by treatment time and unit ID

This is useful for:
- Inspecting match quality and consistency across time periods
- Understanding which units serve as controls for specific treatments
- Debugging matching algorithm performance
- Creating match summaries for reporting

Generate match information DataFrame for refined/calipered models.

# Purpose
Creates match information for models that have undergone refinement or
caliper operations, showing how refined matches relate to the original
full model's ranking system. Useful for understanding how refinement
affects match selection and quality.

# Arguments
- `refined_model`: Refined or calipered CIC model (result of `refine()` or `caliper()`)
- `original_model`: Original full CIC model before refinement
- `maxrank`: Maximum number of matches to include per F period (default: 5)

# Returns
`DataFrame` with columns:
- `timetreated`: Time when treatment occurred
- `treatedunit`: ID of the treated unit
- `f`: Forward period within the outcome window
- `matchunits`: Vector of matched control unit IDs from refined model
- `ranks`: Vector of rank positions from original model's full ranking

# Description
For each treatment observation in the refined model:
1. Finds the corresponding observation in the original model
2. Extracts eligible matches from the refined model
3. Determines their ranks in the original model's full ranking
4. Returns matches sorted by their original ranks

    )

Extract covariate information for treated units at their treatment times.

# Purpose
Gathers covariate values for all treated units at the exact time of their
treatment events. For time-varying covariates, this ensures values are
captured at the moment of treatment rather than at arbitrary time points.
Useful for creating treatment group summaries and balance tables.

# Arguments
- `match_info_df`: DataFrame from `matchinfo()` containing treatment observations
- `data`: Original time-series cross-sectional dataset
- `variables`: Vector of column names to extract (e.g., `[:population, :gdp, :policy_index]`)
- `full_model_observations`: Optional vector of all treatment observations for comparison (default: `nothing`)
- `time_column`: Name of time variable in data (default: `:t`)
- `id_column`: Name of unit identifier in data (default: `:id`)

# Returns
`DataFrame` with columns:
- `timetreated`: Time when treatment occurred
- `treatedunit`: ID of the treated unit
- `removed`: Boolean indicating if observation was removed in refinement (if `full_model_observations` provided)
- Additional columns for each variable in `variables`

# Description
For each unique treatment observation:
1. Identifies the corresponding row in the original data
2. Extracts covariate values at the time of treatment
3. Optionally compares against full model to identify removed observations
4. Returns sorted results with all requested covariate information

This is essential for:
- Creating balance tables showing pre-treatment characteristics
- Comparing refined vs full model treatment groups
- Understanding treatment group composition
- Generating summary statistics for reporting

# Examples
```julia
# Get basic covariate info for treated units
match_df = matchinfo(model)
covariates = [:population, :gdp_per_capita, :unemployment_rate]
treated_info = obsinfo(match_df, data, covariates;
