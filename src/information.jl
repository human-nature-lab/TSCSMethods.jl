    eligibility(model::VeryAbstractCICModel)

Calculate unit eligibility across all treated observations.

# Arguments  
- `model`: Fitted TSCSMethods model

# Returns
- `Matrix{Int}`: Eligibility matrix (units Ã— time periods F)

# Description
For each potential control unit, calculates how many times it is eligible
to serve as a match across all treated observations and time periods.
Higher eligibility indicates units that are consistently good potential matches
for multiple treated units.

Useful for identifying:
- Units that are consistently good matches across multiple treated observations
- Potential issues with match quality or overlap
- Whether certain units dominate the matching process
- Balance in the matching pool

# Examples
```julia
eligibility_matrix = eligibility(model)

# Find highly eligible units
total_eligibility = sum(eligibility_matrix, dims=2)
highly_eligible_indices = findall(x -> x > 5, vec(total_eligibility))
highly_eligible_ids = model.ids[highly_eligible_indices]

println("Units eligible for >5 matches: \$highly_eligible_ids")

# Check eligibility by time period
for (f_idx, f) in enumerate(model.F)
    eligible_count = sum(eligibility_matrix[:, f_idx])
    println("F=\$f: \$eligible_count total eligible matches")
end

"""
    whentreated(unit_id::Int, model::VeryAbstractCICModel)

Find when a specific unit received treatment.

# Arguments
- `unit_id`: ID of the unit to look up  
- `model`: Fitted TSCSMethods model

# Returns
- `Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}}`: Treatment events for this unit as (treatment_time, unit_id)
- `"Unit not found"`: If unit was never treated

# Description
Searches through all treatment observations to find when (if ever)
a specific unit received treatment. Returns all treatment events
for units that may have multiple treatments over time.

This function is useful for:
- Verifying treatment timing for specific units
- Checking if a unit received treatment multiple times
- Debugging treatment assignment issues
- Understanding the treatment history of particular units

# Examples
```julia
# Check when unit 1001 was treated
treatment_events = whentreated(1001, model)

if treatment_events isa String
    println("Unit 1001 was never treated")
else
    treatment_times = [event[1] for event in treatment_events]

"""
    showmatches(model::VeryAbstractCICModel, treatment_observation::Tuple{Int, Int})

Show ranked matches for a specific treatment observation.

# Arguments
- `model`: Fitted TSCSMethods model  
- `treatment_observation`: Tuple of (treatment_time, unit_id)

# Returns
- `Vector{Vector{Int}}`: Ranked matches for each time period F (sorted best to worst)
- `"Treatment observation not found"`: If observation doesn't exist in model

# Description
For a specific treatment event, shows the ranked list of matched control unit indices
for each time period in the post-treatment window F. Units are ranked from
best match (rank 1) to worst match based on the matching algorithm's distance
calculations and balancing constraints.

The returned structure is a vector where each element corresponds to a time period F,
containing the ranked list of control unit indices (internal to model.matches).
To get actual unit IDs, use `model.ids[index]`.

This function is useful for:
- Debugging matching quality for specific treatment events
- Understanding which units serve as matches across different time periods
- Assessing match consistency over time
- Manual inspection of matching results

# Examples
```julia
# Show matches for unit 1001 treated at time 15
matches = showmatches(model, (15, 1001))

if matches isa String
    println(matches)  # "Treatment observation not found"
else

        else
            println("F=\$f: no matches available")
